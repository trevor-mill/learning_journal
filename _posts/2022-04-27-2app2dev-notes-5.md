### JavaScript for Rails

Java is the third standard language of the web (along with HTML and CSS) for browser-readable languages.

Ruby blocks as analogues to JavaScript callbacks. **Callbacks** are used by functional languages (like JavaScript).

The `sinatra` gem makes for a good lightweight server environment for rendering pages as if in a browser, without going through the full `bin/server` process used with the full Rails framework.

**jQuery** (loaded into an HTML page via CDN like Bootstrap or other packages) is a powerful JS library that allows for a lot of smooth functionality by querying the DOM and manipulating returned elements in an AJAX (_asynchronous JavaScript and XML_) web development fashion.

Think of JavaScript's `function() {...}` as the same as Ruby's `do...end`, aka a block. Easier to visualize mentally.

`dom_id`, `escape_javascript` are important new helper methods to get comfortable with.

Now that we're using JavaScript, we need to rely heavily on browser tools to debug any issues with the JavaScript view templates. The server log can still provide insight into any bugs with the RCAV process leading up to the JavaScript rendering.

**Partials are amazing!**
